# LewisHackathonApp
This the functionally disfunctional game I made for the hackathon with Lewis.
For playing the game you must import the following libraries:


import random
import pygame
import sys
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox
from time import sleep
Then you can play it.
