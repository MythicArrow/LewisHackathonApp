This the functionally disfunctional game I made for the hackathon with Lewis.

![Ekran Görüntüsü (151)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39370c41-ffa2-42ee-b2e4-4661c8b761cd)

Import them with the following commands

pip install tensorflow

pip install numpy

pip install tkinter

pip install pygame

Other libraries doesn't need this commands because they are already built-in.
